### What I Do...
I work on the GPU design verification team at Apple, which means I make sure
the hardware design of the Apple Silicon graphics architecture works correctly
before it is sent to the fab.


### Where I'm From...
I grew up in New Hampshire and got my BS and MEng in Computer Engineering from
the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign. I currently live in Austin, TX.
